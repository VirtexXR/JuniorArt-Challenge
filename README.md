## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Blender or equivalent
- Make sure that you are using Unreal 4.26.2 or above

## The Problem

We have the Lounge area and we need a pool table for users to play a pool mini game we are developing. We need you to take this concept art and build the prop.

In addition to the concept, feel free to explore with the idea of a user interface or accessories such as balls or cues.

The pool table and the accessories will need to be modelled and textured in your preferred tools (Blender is a bonus) and brought into Unreal Engine for rendering, lighting and then finally submission.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take an existing concept and extend that to additional features or functionality. This is also intended as an opportunity for you to showcase your hard surface modelling, texturing.

This is not intended to be a complex asset, more so something simple and functional with room to showcase some of your skills and ideas.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 2 days.

## Requirements

- Submitted as an Unreal Engine Project file in addition to source files for your respective modelling/texturing software
- Light baking and reflections to be carried out in UE4
- Clean topology, low poly
- Ensure the materials respect PBR values
- 2k textures limit, 1k/m texel density
- Bake from highpoly, feel free to use any tool for baking.
- Add details on texture like bolts, screws, sings, logo, score display, etc.

## Bonuses

- Any animated shaders
- A user interface to start a game etc
- Accessories/props
- Organise assets and folders as you would normally

## Submission

To submit your work please upload the relevant files (FBXs, Substance, Blender files, Unreal files, TGAs) to WeTransfer or GDrive. Once ready please share with [Raoul](mailto:raoul@virtexstadium.com)
